# remark-html-katex

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use `remark-rehype` to move from remark (markdown) to rehype (HTML)
and then replace `remark-html-katex` with [`rehype-katex`][rehype-katex]
or [`rehype-mathjax`][rehype-mathjax].

Legacy [documentation for this package](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/52b145855df58e0cd85c2171452f192181cfb43d/packages/remark-html-katex)
is still available in Git.
